# Uetke

Uetke is a project started by [Aquiles Carattino](https://www.aquiles.me) ([github](https://github.com/aquilesC)) to develop software for scientific labs. 

Many of the projects were custom developments for research labs. Some continued their own life. 

## Current Status

The focus of the project switched towards workshops and consultancy, and is organized around [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com). 

## Reaching Out
